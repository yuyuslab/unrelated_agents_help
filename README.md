# What is the purpose of this repository
- This repository is for organising information to answer a queston "What is a condition where the unrelated individuals help each other?". 
- A motivation of making this repository (or a space) was that the definitions of whatever needed to consider the question have been quite scattered and not standardised. 
- So, it maybe better to divide each concept into as small part as possible or small enough that people don't confound it with something else (which is more realistic).

# How to use this repository
1. Look for the concept you are familiar with
2. See if you can regard the current concept as a single unconfounded concept
3. If you think it is all right, just go to another concept
4. If you think it is confounded by multiple concept, make a pull request after editing the respective part

# Who can use this repository
- Anyone who comply moral sense
